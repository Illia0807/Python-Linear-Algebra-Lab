# Python Linear Algebra Lab

This repository serves as a practical lab and personal study guide for the concepts of Linear Algebra. The projects within are based on the material from Gilbert Strang's "Introduction to Linear Algebra" and MIT OpenCourseWare lectures.

The main goal is to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application by implementing and visualizing key algorithms and ideas using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## üéØ Objectives

* **Deepen Understanding:** Solidify theoretical knowledge by building tangible Python scripts for core Linear Algebra concepts.
* **Develop Practical Skills:** Gain hands-on experience with scientific computing libraries like NumPy and data visualization tools like Matplotlib.
* **Explore Real-World Applications:** Go beyond textbook exercises by creating small, real-world inspired problems that can be solved using the learned material (e.g., robotics, computer graphics, data analysis).
* **Build a Portfolio:** Create a collection of clean, well-commented projects that showcase my ability to translate mathematical concepts into functional code.

## üìÇ Projects

This repository will contain a series of small, focused projects. Each project will include:
* A Python script with clear, commented code.
* A brief explanation of the mathematical concept it demonstrates.

### Current Projects:
* **Project 1: 3D Vector & Plane Visualizer**
    * A script that takes two vectors as input, calculates the equation of the plane they span, and visualizes the vectors and the resulting plane in a 3D plot. It also checks if a third vector lies on this plane.

*(This section will be updated as new projects are added.)*
